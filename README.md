Apnea training app

This version of the great app "apnea tables" will be more flexible and relate to the way I was taught to train on apnea.

It will wait till you feel the need to breath and than will start counting sec.

In addition I hope to fix the bugs relating to the bluetooth problems I encountered and to have a proper log to it.
